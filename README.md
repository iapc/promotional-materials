IA Programming Club Promotional Materials
=========================================

These assets are intended for promotional materials for the club in the coming year. Contributions are very welcome from all club members.

Logos
-----

Logos were created using variants of the Open Sans font. Originals found in SVG format. Alternative designs have been created in the past and these are welcome as well.

T-Shirts
--------

Not much demand for these at the moment, but concepts are welcome and could be done in the future. 

Flyers
------

Mostly simple designs, can easily be improved upon by the more design oriented members of the club.

TODO
====
* Distribute flyers at the start of the year
* Have a presence at freshman orientation
* Put up flyers in the beginning of the year while people are looking for clubs they find interesting
* Use logo on website and social media profiles when needed
